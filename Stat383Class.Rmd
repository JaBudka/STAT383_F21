This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r Sept15}
Ex2p32a <- (choose(12,5)*choose(8,0))/choose(20,5)
Ex2p32a

Ex2p32b <- (choose(8,4)*choose(12,1))/choose(20,5)
Ex2p32b

Ex2p33 <- (choose(13,1)*choose(4,2))/choose(52,2)
Ex2p33


```

```{r Quiz 2}
Quiz2 <- (choose(13,1)*choose(4,3))*(choose(12,1)*choose(4,2))/choose(52,5)
Quiz2

```


```{r HW 2 mess around}
